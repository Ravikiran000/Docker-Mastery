# Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Docker Compose, you can use a YAML file to configure your application's services, networks, and volumes, enabling you to manage multiple containers as a single application.

### Scenario: 
Youâ€™re building a web application consisting of: A frontend built with React. A backend API developed in Node.js. A database using MySQL. Instead of running each service separately using docker run commands, you decide to use Docker Compose for simplicity.

## Implementation:

Here we are creating multiple dockerfiles and using docker compose to execute them simultaneously.

1. Install docker on an Linux EC2 instance
   
   curl https://get.docker.com/ | bash
   
2. Install docker compose on the docker ec2 instance
   2.1 First move to /usr/local/bin and enter the commands given below
        cd /usr/local/bin
        https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.30.3/docker-compose-linux-x86_64
   
   2.2 rename the file & chnage permissions
        mv docker-compose-linux-x86_64 compose
        chmod 700 compose
   
   2.3 check for version and go to previous root directory
         compose --version
         cd
   
Dockerfile1:

FROM ubuntu:latest

LABEL name="ravikiran"

RUN apt update && apt install -y jq net-tools curl wget unzip\
    && apt install -y nginx iputils-ping

CMD ["nginx","-g","daemon off;"]

2. Create 2 more dockerfiles with names as "Dockerfile2" & "Dockerfile3"

3. create a docker compose file as "docker-compose.yml"
   
version: "3.8"
services:
  dockerfile1:
    build:
      contex: .
      dockerfile: dockerfile1
    container_name: dev
  dockerfile2:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: dockerfile2
    container_name: staging
  dockerfile3:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: dockerfile3
    container_name: prod

4. Run the compose file with "docker compose up -d", this will start building the docker images and run the containers in detached mode.
5. You can see that multiple containers were started simutaneously.

### you can also try the below project. Just the check the code and execute the compose files with "docker compose up -d"
